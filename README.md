Project Overview:
Efficient memory management is one of the core responsibilities of an operating system, especially in environments where physical memory is limited and must be optimally utilized. In such systems, page replacement algorithms play a critical role in determining which memory pages to remove when new pages need to be loaded into memory.
This project, titled “Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator”, is a comprehensive, web-based educational tool designed to simulate, visualize, and compare the behaviour and performance of different page replacement algorithms in real-time. The simulator enables users to gain practical insight into how different algorithms handle page faults under varying input conditions, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and actual execution behaviour.
🔹 Algorithms Simulated:
The simulator supports four of the most widely studied page replacement algorithms:
●	FIFO (First-In-First-Out): Replaces the oldest loaded page in memory.
●	LRU (Least Recently Used): Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time.
●	Optimal: Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future (ideal but requires future knowledge).
●	LFU (Least Frequently Used): Replaces the page with the lowest frequency of use.
🔹 Key Features:
●	Interactive Simulation: Users can input a custom page reference string and specify the number of memory frames.
●	Step-by-Step Animation: Each page request is processed one at a time with “Previous”, “Play/Pause”, and “Next” controls for detailed analysis.
●	Explanation Box: Each step includes a real-time explanation of what decision the algorithm is making and why.
●	Performance Metrics: The total number of page faults for each algorithm is displayed.
●	Chart-Based Comparison: Using Chart.js, a bar graph compares the efficiency of each algorithm visually.
●	Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of the simulation to suit their learning pace.
●	Responsive UI: The simulator uses modern HTML, CSS (with a dark theme), and JavaScript to ensure an intuitive user experience across devices.
🔹 Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a hands-on learning experience for students studying operating systems. By visualizing how different algorithms behave for the same input, users can develop a deeper understanding of:
●	How each algorithm makes page replacement decisions
●	How different algorithms perform under various workloads
●	The concept of page faults and memory frame utilization
🔹 Technology Stack:
●	HTML5: Structure and layout of the web interface
●	CSS3: Styling, animations, and responsive design
●	JavaScript: Core simulation logic, interactivity, and algorithm implementation
●	Chart.js: For rendering comparative performance graphs
●	Font Awesome: Iconography for control buttons and info panels
🔹 Significance:
This simulator is a valuable tool for both self-learners and instructors. It helps users visualize complex memory management concepts in a clear and interactive way. Unlike static textbook examples, this dynamic tool enhances engagement and reinforces theoretical knowledge with practical demonstration.
