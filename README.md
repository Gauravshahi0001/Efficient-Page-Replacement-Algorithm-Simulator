Brief Description:
Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator** is an interactive web application designed to demonstrate and compare four popular page replacement algorithms: FIFO, LRU, Optimal, and 'LFU'. It allows users to visually understand how each algorithm handles page faults, making it a great tool for students, educators, and professionals studying operating systems.

## üß† Features

- Simulates four algorithms: FIFO, LRU, Optimal, LFU.
- Visual Comparison: Shows a bar graph comparing page faults for each algorithm using **Chart.js**.
- Step-by-step Visualization: Shows each algorithm's behavior in real-time.
- Full Animation Control: Play, pause, next, and previous controls for step navigation.
- Adjustable Speed: Control the speed of the animation.
- Real-time Explanations: Detailed breakdown of each step during the simulation.
- Sleek Dark Mode UI: Modern design with responsive layout.
- Lightweight: Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**‚Äîno frameworks required.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
- HTML5: Markup language for the webpage.
- CSS: Styling with responsive design.
- Vanilla JavaScript: Core functionality and logic.
- Chart.js: Used for visualizing page faults in a bar chart.
- Font Awesome: Provides intuitive icons for controls.

  ## üö¶ Getting Started:
  ### 1. Clone the Repository

These instructions will help you set up the project locally so you can explore and run the Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator on your machine.

 Clone the Repository:

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/page-replacement-simulator.git
cd page-replacement-simulator

npm install -g http-server
http-server

### Key Points:
- Step 1: Clone the repository using `git clone`.
- Step 2: Open the project by simply opening the `index.html` file in a browser. This is the simplest way, since your app doesn't require any back-end services or databases.
- Optional: Add local server setup if users might need it (useful for development or when running a local server for testing).

## üß™ How to Use

1. **Input**: Enter a page reference string (comma-separated integers).
2. **Frames**: Specify the number of frames available in the system.
3. **Run Simulation**: Click the "Run Simulation" button to start the simulation.
4. **Control**: Use the following buttons to navigate:
   - ‚èÆÔ∏è **Previous**: Go back one step.
   - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Play/Pause**: Start/pause the animation.
   - ‚è≠Ô∏è **Next**: Move to the next step.
5. **Watch**: Observe the step-by-step animations and see real-time explanations.
6. **Bar Chart**: Review the page fault comparison with the bar graph.
